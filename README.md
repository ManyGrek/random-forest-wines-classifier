# Random forest classifier implementation
In this implementation we make use of the wine dataset included in the scikit-learn module in junction with the RandomForestClassifier class of the same module.
The purpose of this implementation is to show the knowledge about the use of the machine learning framework scikit-learn.
## The wine dataset
The wine dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset.
